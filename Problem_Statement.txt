Create a python script that can: 
1. connect to the SQLite3 database provided. 
2. extract the total quantities of each item bought per customer aged 18-35.
 - For each customer, get the sum of each item
 - Items with no purchase (total quantity=0) should be omitted from the final list. 
- No decimal points allowed Challenge: Provide 2 solutions one using SQL and other using Pandas
 3. Store the query to a CSV File, delimiter should be the semicolon character. 
Test Case: Customer 1 brought item X on multiple occasions, totaling 10 for item X only Customer 2 brought one of each item only once, totaling 1 each item 
Customer 3 brought item Z on two occasions, totaling 2 for item Z only 
Then the output file should look like the example below: 
Customer;Age;Item;Quantity 
1;21;x;10
2;23;x;1
2;23;y;1 
2;23;z;1
3;35;z;2
